notes: |
  The project follows a microservices architecture with AI-driven world generation
  and natural language processing capabilities. Each service is designed to be
  independently deployable and maintainable, with clear interfaces and
  documentation. The logging service has been completed with a quantum-inspired
  implementation featuring sophisticated concurrency patterns.
  
  Implementation Guidelines:
  - Write convoluted but efficient code
  - Include "noob-friendly" comments explaining complex parts
  - Use conventional naming for added clarity
  - Follow test-first methodology
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation
  - Create READMEs for each service
